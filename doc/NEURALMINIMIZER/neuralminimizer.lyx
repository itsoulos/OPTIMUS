\begin_layout Abstract
The problem of finding the global minimum of multidimensional functions
 is often applied to a wide range of problems.
 An innovative technique for finding the global minimum is proposed in this
 paper.
 In this technique, an estimation of the objective function is constructed
 using an RBF network.
 The network constantly updates the estimation for the objective function
 with information it gathers from performing local minimizations.
 In addition, the proposed technique uses as a termination criterion a widely
 used criterion from the relevant literature which in fact evaluates it
 after each execution of the local minimization.
 The proposed technique was applied to a number of well-known problems from
 the relevant literature, and the comparative results with respect to modern
 global minimization techniques are shown extremely promising.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An innovative method for finding the global minimum of multidimensional
 functions is presented here.
 The functions considered are continuous and differentiable function and
 defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $f:S\rightarrow R,S\subset R^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The problem of locating the global optimum is usually formulated as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x)\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]

\end_inset

A variety of problems in the physical world can be represented as global
 minimum problems, such as problems from physics

 A systematic review of global optimization methods can also be found in
 the work of Floudas et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In addition, during the last few years, a variety of work has been proposed
 on combinations and modifications to some global optimization methods to
 more efficiently find the global minimum, such as methods that combine
 PSO with other methods

, new stopping rules to efficiently terminate the global optimization techniques
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 etc.
 Also, due to the massive use of parallel processing techniques, several
 methods have been proposed that take full advantage of parallel processing,
 such as parallel techniques

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, a new multi-start method is proposed that uses a machine
 learning model, which is trained in parallel with the evolution of the
 optimization process.
 Although multistart methods are considered the basis for more modern optimizati
on techniques, they have been successfully used in several problems such
 as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

 etc.
 In the new technique, a Radial Basis Function (RBF) network 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rbf_main1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is used to construct an approximation of the objective function.
 This construction is carried out in parallel with the execution of the
 optimization.
 A limited number of samples from the objective function and the local minima
 discovered during the optimization are used to construct the approximation
 function.
 During the execution of the method, the samples needed to start local minimizer
s are taken from the approximation function that is constructed by the neural
 network.
 The RBF network was used as an approximation tool as it has been successfully
 used in a wide range of problems in the field of artificial intelligence
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rbf_face,rbf_function1,rbf_function2,rbf_image"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and its training procedure is very fast, if compared to artificial neural
 networks for example.
 In addition, for more efficient termination of the method, a termination
 method proposed by Tsoulos is used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tsoulos1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but this termination method is applied after each execution of the local
 minimization procedure.
 The proposed technique was applied to a series of problems from the relevant
 literature and the results are extremely promising even compared to established
 global optimization techniques.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed technique generates an estimation of the objective function
 during the optimization using an RBF network.
 This estimation is initially generated from some samples from the objective
 function and gradually local minima that will have been discovered during
 the optimization are added to it.
 In this way, the estimation of the objective function will be continuously
 improved to approximate the true function as much as possible.
 At every iteration, several samples are then taken from the estimated function
 and sorted in ascending order.
 Those with the lowest value will be starting points of the local minimization
 method.
 The local optimization method used here is a BFGS variant of Powell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "powell"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This process has the effect of drastically reducing the total number of
 function calls that are made and, at the same time, the points used as
 initiators of the local minimization technique approach the global minimum
 of the objective function.
 Also, the proposed method checks the termination rule after the application
 of every local search method.
 That way, if the absolute minimum has already been discovered with some
 certainty, no more function calls will be wasted finding it.

To estimate the efficiency of the new technique a number of functions from
 the relevant literature were used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Ali1,Floudas1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 These functions are provided in the Appendix.
 The proposed technique was tested on the these test functions and the results
 produced were compared with those given by a simple genetic algorithm or
 a PSO method or differential evolution (DE) method.
 In order to have fairness in the comparison of the results, for all global
 optimizition techniques the same local minimization method has been used
 as that of the proposed method.
 In addition, the number of chromosomes in the genetic algorithm and the
 number of particles in the PSO method are identical to the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{T}$
\end_inset

 of the proposed procedure.
 Also, for the DE method the number of agents was set to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{T}$
\end_inset

.
 The values for the used parameters are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Experimental-settings."
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The conducted experiments were executed 30 times for each test function
 and averages were taken.
 In each execution, different seed for the random generator was used.
 The proposed method is implemented as the method with the name 
\emph on
NeuralMinimizer

 All the experiments were conducted on an AMD Ryzen 5950X with 128GB of

The experimental results from the application of the proposed method and
 the other methods are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The number show in the cells denote average function calls.
 The fraction in parentheses represents the fraction of executions where
 the global optimum was successfully found.
 When this number is absent, then the global minimum is computed for every
 execution (100% success).
 At the end of the table, an additional row named AVERAGE indicates the
 total number of function calls and the average success rate in locating
 the global minimum.
 In the experimental results, the superiority of the proposed technique
 over the other two methods in terms of the number of function calls is
 clear.
 The proposed technique requires an average of 90% fewer function calls
 than the other methods.
 In addition, the proposed technique appears to be more efficient than the
 other two as it finds more times on average the global minimum of most
 test functions in the experiments.
 Also, the statistical comparison between the global optimization methods
 is shown in Figure

 As can be seen, the increase in this parameter does not cause a large increase
 in the total number of function calls, while at the same time it improves
 to some extent the ability of the proposed technique to find the global
 minimum.

\begin_layout Standard
An innovative technique for finding the global minimum of multidimensional
 functions was presented in this work.
 This new technique is based on the multistart procedure, but also generates
 an estimation of the objective function through a machine learning model.
 The machine learning model constructs an estimation of the objective function
 using a small number of samples from the true function but also with the
 contribution of local minima discovered during the execution of the method.
 In this way, the estimation of the objective function is continuously improved
 and the sampling to perform local minimization is done from the estimated
 function rather than the actual one.
 This procedure combined with checking the termination criterion after each
 execution of the local minimization method led the proposed method to have
 excellent results both in terms of the speed of finding the global minimum
 and its efficiency.
 In addition, the method shows significant stability in its performance
 even in large changes of its parameters as presented in the experimental
 results section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, the use of the RBF network to construct an approximation
 of the objective function can be applied to more modern optimization techniques
 such as genetic algorithms.
 It would also be interesting to create a parallel implementation of the
 proposed method, in order to significantly speed up its execution and to
 be able to be used efficiently in optimization problems of higher dimensions.
