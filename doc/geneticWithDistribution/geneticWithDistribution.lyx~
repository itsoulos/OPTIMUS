\begin_layout Abstract
The need to find the global minimum in multivariable functions is a critical
 problem in many fields of science and technology.
 Effectively solving this problem requires the creation of initial solution
 estimates, which are subsequently used by the optimization algorithm to
 search for the best solution in the solution space.
 In the context of this article, a novel approach to generating the initial
 solution distribution is presented which is applied to a genetic optimization
 algorithm.
 Using the k-means clustering algorithm, a distribution based on data similarity
 is created.
 This helps in generating initial estimates that may be more tailored to
 the problem.
 Additionally, the proposed method employs a rejection sampling algorithm
 to discard samples that do not yield better solution estimates in the optimizat
ion process.
 This allows the algorithm to focus on potentially optimal solutions, thus
 improving its performance.
 Finally, the article presents experimental results from the application
 of this approach to various optimization problems, providing the scientific
 community with a new method for addressing this significant problem.

\begin_layout Standard
The task of locating the global minimum of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 can be defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x)\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\times\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\times\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]

\end_inset

This task finds application in a variety of real world problems, such as
 problems from physics

 The methods aimed at finding the global minimum are divided into two major
 categories: deterministic methods and stochastic methods.
 The most frequently encountered techniques of the first category are interval
 techniques 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which partition the initial domain of the objective function until a promising
 subset is found to find the global minimum.
 The second category includes the vast majority of methods and in its ranks
 one can find methods such as Controlled Random Search methods

One of the basic techniques included in the area of stochastic techniques
 is Genetic Algorithms, initially proposed by John Holland 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The operation of genetic algorithms is inspired by biology, and for this
 reason, it utilizes the idea of evolution through genetic mutation, natural

Genetic algorithms can be combined with machine learning to solve complex
 problems and optimize models.
 More specifically, the genetic algorithm has been applied in many machine
 learning applications, such as in the article by Ansari et al, which deals
 with the recognition of digital modulation signals.
 In this article, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize machine learning
 models by adjusting their features and parameters to achieve better signal
 recognition accuracy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Ansari"

.
 Additionally, in the study by Ji et al, a methodology is proposed that
 uses machine learning models to predict amplitude deviation in hot rolling,
 while genetic algorithms are employed to optimize the machine learning
 models and select features to improve prediction accuracy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, in the article by Santana, Alonso, and Nieto, which focuses
 on the design and optimization of 5G networks in indoor environments, the
 use of genetic algorithms and machine learning models is identified for
 estimating path loss, which is critical for determining signal strength
 and coverage indoors

Another interesting article is by Liu et al, which discusses the use of
 genetic algorithms in robotics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The authors propose a methodology that utilizes genetic algorithms to optimize
 the trajectory and motion of digital twin robots.
 A similar study was presented by Nonoyama et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nonoyama"

\end_inset

, where the research focused on optimizing energy consumption during the
 motion planning of a dual-arm industrial robot.
 The goal of the research is to minimize energy consumption during the process
 of object retrieval and placement.
 To achieve this, both genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization
 algorithms are used to adjust the robot's motion trajectory, thereby increasing
 its energy efficiency.

The use of genetic algorithms is still prevalent even in the business world.
 In the article by Liu et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the application of genetic algorithms in an effort to optimize energy
 conservation in a high-speed Methanol Spark Ignition engine fueled with
 Methanol and gasoline blends is discussed.
 In this study, genetic algorithms were used as an optimization technique
 to find the best operating conditions for the engine, such as the air-fuel
 ratio, ignition timing, and other engine control variables, aiming to save
 energy and reduce energy consumption and emissions.
 In another research, the optimization of the placement of electric vehicle
 charging stations is carried out

Moreover, genetic algorithms are extremely useful in the field of medicine,
 as they are employed in therapy optimization, medical personnel training,
 genetic diagnosis, and genomic research.
 More specifically, in the study by Doewes, Nair & Sharma

 characteristics related to the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes
 COVID-19.
 In this article, genetic algorithms are used for data analysis and processing
 to extract significant characteristics that can aid in the effective diagnosis
 of COVID-19.

The current work aims to improve the efficiency of the genetic algorithm
 in global optimization problems, by introducing a new way of initializing
 the population's chromosomes.
 In the new initialization technique, the k-means 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 method is used to find initial values of the chromosomes that will lead
 to finding the global minimum faster and more efficient than chromosomes
 generated by some random distribution.
 Also, the proposed technique discards chromosomes which, after applying
 the k-means technique, are close to each other.

\begin_layout Standard
During the past years, many researchers have proposed variations for the
 initialization of genetic algorithms, such as the work of Maaranen et al
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, where they discuss the usage of quasi-random sequences in the initial
 population of a genetic algorithm.
 Similarly, Paul et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gainit2"

\end_inset

 proposed initializing the population of genetic algorithm using a Vari-begin
 and Vari-diversity (VV) population seeding technique.
 Also, in the same direction of research, Li et al proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gainit3"

 a knowledge-based technique to initialize genetic algorithms used mainly
 in discrete problems.
 Recently, Hassanat et al suggested the incorporation of regression techniques
 for the initialization of genetic algorithms.

The fundamental operation of a genetic algorithm mimics the process of natural
 evolution.
 The algorithm begins by creating an initial population of solutions, called
 chromosomes that represents a potential solution to the objective problem.
 The genetic algorithm operates by reproducing and evolving populations
 of solutions through iterative steps.
 Following the analogy to natural evolution, the genetic algorithm allows
 optimal solutions to "evolve" through successive generations.
 The main steps of the used genetic algorithm are described below:

The current work proposes a novel method to initiate the chromosomes, that
 utilizes the well - known technique of k-means.
 The significance of the initial distribution in solution finding within
 optimization is essential across various domains and techniques.
 Apart from genetic algorithms, the initial distribution impacts other optimizat
ion methods like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

 The initial distribution defines the starting solutions that will evolve
 and improve throughout the algorithm.
 If the initial population contains solutions close to the optimum, it increases
 the likelihood of evolved solutions being in proximity to the optimal solution.
 Conversely, if the initial population is distant from the optimum, the
 algorithm might need more iterations to reach the optimal solution or even
 get stuck in a suboptimal solution.
 In conclusion, the initial distribution influences the stability, convergence
 speed, and quality of optimization algorithm outcomes.
 Thus, selecting a suitable initial distribution is crucial for the algorithm's
 efficiency and the discovery of the optimal solution in a reasonable time

Proposed initialization distribution

\begin_layout Standard
The present work replaces the randomness of the initialization of the chromosome
s by using the k-means technique.
 More specifically, the method takes a series of samples from the objective
 function and then the k-means method is used to locate the centers of these
 points.
 These centers can then be used as chromosomes in the genetic algorithm.

 The k-means algorithm is a clustering algorithm widely used in data analysis
 and machine learning.
 Its primary objective is to partition a dataset into k clusters, where
 data points within the same cluster are similar to each other and differ
 from data points in other clusters.
 Specifically, k-means seeks cluster centers and assigns samples to each
 cluster, aiming to minimize the distance within clusters and maximize the
 distance between cluster centers

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://github.com/itsoulos/OPTIMUS
\end_layout

\end_inset

(accessed on 9 September 2023).
 The genetic algorithm variant of OPTIMUS package used in the conducted
 experiments was the pDoubleGenetic algorithm, that can utilize different
 methods for the initialization of chromosomes.
 The machine used in the experiments was an AMD Ryzen 5950X with 128GB of
 RAM, running the Debian Linux operating system.
 To ensure research reliability, the experiments were executed 30 times
 for each objective function, employing different seeds for the random generator
, and reporting the mean values.
 The values used for the parameters in the experiments are listed in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expValues"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The values in the experimental tables denote average number of function
 calls.
 For the experimental tables, the following notation is used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The column UNIFORM indicates the incorporation of uniform sampling in the
 genetic algorithm.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

 randomly selected chromosomes using uniform sampling are used in the genetic
 algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The column TRIANGULAR defines the usage of triangular distribution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "triangular"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for the initial samples of the genetic algorithm.
 For this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

 randomly selected chromosomes with triangular distribution are used in
 the genetic algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The column KMEANS denotes the application of k - means sampling as proposed
 here in the genetic algorithm.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{m}$
\end_inset

 randomly selected points were sampled from the objective function and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 centers were produced using the k - means algorithm.
 In order to have a fair comparison between the results produced between
 the proposed technique and the rest, the number of centers produced by
 the k-means method was set to be equal to the number of chromosomes 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

 of the rest of the techniques.
 Ten times the number of initial points were used to produce the centers.
 In addition, through the discard process of Algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:Chromosome-rejection-rule"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, some centers will be eliminated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The numbers in cells represent the average number of function calls required
 to obtain the global minimum.
 The fraction in parentheses denotes the percentage where the global minimum
 was successfully discovered.
 If this fraction is absent, then the global minimum was successfully discovered
 in all runs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In every table, an additional line was added under the name TOTAL, representing
 the total number of function calls and, in parentheses, the average success
 rate in finding the global minimum.

s, along with the objective function evaluations.
 It is evident that with the proposed initialization, the evaluations are
 fewer compared to the other two initialization methods.
 Specifically, compared to the uniform initialization, there is a reduction
 of 47.88%, while in comparison to the triangular initialization, the reduction
 is 50.25%.
 As for the success rates, no significant differences are observed and graphical
ly outlined in Figure

 It is evident that with the proposed initialization, the results are improved
 compared to those of the uniform distribution.
 Additionally, as expected, the required function evaluations increase in
 parallel with the dimension of the problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Likewise, a series of experiments were conducted for the CM function with
 the dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 increased from 2 to 30, and the results are shown in Table

 The proposed initialization method requires fewer function calls to obtain
 the global minimum of the function and also the average success rate with
 the proposed initialization method reaches 100%, whereas with the uniform
 distribution it is smaller by 15%.

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, an innovative chromosome initialization method for genetic
 algorithms was proposed that utilizes the well-known k-means technique.
 These genetic algorithms are used to find the global minimum of multidimensiona
l functions.
 This method replaces the initialization of chromosomes in genetic algorithms
 which is traditionally performed by some random distribution with centers
 produced by the k-means technique.
 In addition, in this technique, centers that are close enough are rejected
 from being genetic algorithm chromosomes.
 The above procedure significantly reduced the required number of function
 calls compared to random distributions and furthermore, in difficult high-dimen
sional functions, it appears to be a more efficient technique at finding
 the global minimum than random distributions.
 Future research may include incorporation of parallel techniques such as
 MPI

 or OpenMP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to speed up the method or application of the initialization process to
 other stochastic techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization or Differential
 Evolution.
