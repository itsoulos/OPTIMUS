\begin_layout Abstract
A widely used method that constructs features with the incorporation of
 the so - called Grammatical Evolution is proposed here to predict the COVID-19
 cases as well as the mortality rate.
 The method creates new artificial features from the original ones using
 a Genetic algorithm and is guided by BNF grammar.

\series bold
 
\series default
After the artificial features are generated, the original data set is modified
 based on these features and an artificial neural network is applied to
 the modified data and the results are reported.
 From the comparative experiments done, it was clear that feature construction
 has an advantage over other machine learning methods for predicting pandemic
 elements.

Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world changed in December 2019, when the first reports emerged of a
 mysterious infection in the Chinese province, Wuhan.
 Subsequently, the WHO
\series bold
 (
\series default
World Health Organization) declared a new global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
 The name given to the new coronavirus was SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory
 Syndrome) and the name given to the corresponding disease was COVID-19.

\series bold
 
\series default
As Andersen mentioned 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Andersen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the virus's origin is natural selection in an animal host before the zoonotic
 transfer or natural selection in humans following the zoonotic transfer.

\series bold
 
\series default
At the time of writing, the number of diagnosed cases of COVID-19 was about
 650.000.000 and the number of people who had died was over 6.500.000.
 So the fatality rate was about 1%, although this rate may be lower since
 many people have fallen ill without undergoing any diagnostic test.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the seriousness of the topic, since the beginning of the pandemic
 until now, a multitude of publications have appeared in the relevant literature
 on this topic and many of them use computational techniques to predict
 the course of the disease.
 For example, Wang 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wang"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 used the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), that uses real - time
 data collected from patients in Wuhan.
 With this data, he wrote an algorithm to forecast the death rates.
 Also, Tomar and Gupta 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gupta"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the number of COVID-19 cases.
 Zhang et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhang"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 used a Poisson model to analyze the COVID-19 cases in Canada,France,Germany,
 Italy, UK and USA.
 Pinter et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pinter"

\end_inset

 used an ANFIS system and a multilayered perceptron- imperialist competitive
 algorithm (MLP-ICA) to predict the mortality rate for Hungary.

\series bold
 
\series default
Smith et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Smith"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, used machine learning techniques for a dataset made of blood samples taken
 from COVID-19 patients from a hospital in the region of Wuhan, in order
 to estimate the mortality rate.

\series bold
 
\series default
Additionally, papers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 using machine learning techniques to recognize faces behind masks has emerged
 in recent years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current work utilizes a feature construction method initially presented
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fcmain"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, to predict the COVID-19 cases and deaths for a series of randomly selected
 countries.
 The method is based on Grammatical Evolution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gemain"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and creates artificial features from the original ones without a priory
 knowledge of the structure of the problem.
 The method has been used with success in a series of scientific fields
 such as Spam identification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fc1"

, Fetal heart classification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "fc2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, epileptic oscillations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fcmain"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 etc.
 Also, recently a software that implements the feature construction method
 using modern programming approaches has been published 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "qfc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the case of the COVID-19 data, the only feature is the recording time
 in ascending form and the output is the number of cases or deaths on that
 recording.
 The proposed method creates 1-3 artificial features from the recording
 time and, subsequently, an artificial neural network 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "neural1,neural2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is trained on the modified data.
 The experimental results are compared against other methods used to train
 neural networks and the proposed technique appears to significantly outperform
 the others in terms of accuracy.
 The Grammatical Evolution utilizes a Genetic algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "genetic1,genetic2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to produce new features from the old ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, genetic algorithms have been used in variety of symmetry problems
 from the relevant literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 Recently, Krippendorf and Syvaeri have used artificial neural networks
 to detect symmetries in datasets

Furthermore, a series of recent works have been proposed to model the dynamics
 of the COVID-19 virus using fractional derivatives

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed technique is divided into two phases.
 During the first phase, artificial new features are created from the original
 ones using Grammatical Evolution and a Genetic Algorithm.
 The new features are evaluated using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) network
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rbf1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 processing units.
 The RBF network is selected as the evaluator because the training procedure
 of RBF is much faster than those of artificial neural networks.
 Subsequently, in the second phase, the original dataset is transformed
 using the best located features and a Genetic Algorithm is used to train
 a neural network on the modified dataset.
 A schematic representation of the whole process is shown in Figure

 of a sequence number for each production rule.

\series bold

The chromosomes in Grammatical Evolution are integer numbers representing
 sequence numbers of production rules.
 Subsequently, the production procedure starts from the start symbol of
 the grammar and produces valid programs by replacing non - terminal symbols
 with the right hand of the selected production rule.
 The selection of the rule has two steps:

Afterwards a genetic algorithm is used to train an artificial neural network

 hidden nodes for this dataset.
 The neural network used here is defined as a function 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(x,w\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is the weight vector to be estimated through the genetic algorithm after
 the minimization of the following training error: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(N\left(x,w\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\mbox{FC}\left(x_{i},g_{b}\right),w\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:trainError}

The neural network has a form also used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.

\series bold

If the neural network has one processing level, every output of each hidden
 node is in the form:
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
o_{i}(x)=\sigma\left(p_{i}^{T}x+\theta_{i}\right),\label{eq:eq1-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\series default
where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the weight vector and 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$

is considered as the bias for output 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $i.$

The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 is the well - known sigmoid function given by: 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\series default
For a neural network with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 hidden nodes the final output is given by:
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}v_{i}o_{i}(x),\label{eq:eq1-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\series default
where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the weight for hidden node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, if we use one weight 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 for hidden nodes and biases the following form could be used for he neural
 network:
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\series default
The value 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 the size of input vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}.$
\end_inset

 Also, the total number of parameters of vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $(d+2)\times H$
\end_inset

.

 database, one dataset for the number of cases on every day of the pandemic
 and one dataset for the number of deaths on every day of the pandemic.
 Every run was executed 30 times for every dataset and averages were measured.
 The random number generator used was the drand48() of the C programming
 language.

 for cases prediction and deaths prediction respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the execution of the above experiments, it is clear in principle that
 the efficiency of the methods depends to a great extent on the country
 in question.
 In some countries the test error is high and in others quite low.
 This is probably due to the different course of the number of cases and
 the mortality rate in each country separately.
 For example, if one looks at the experimental results for Brazil, one will
 find that all the methods present a relatively high error.
 This may be due to the large and abrupt changes that the disease has caused
 in this country, as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BrazilJohnHopkins"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, which shows the course of deaths in this country and is available from
 Johns Hopkins University.
 However, even in this country using the proposed methodology, there was
 a large reduction in approximation error of 90%.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the proposed method has higher accuracy than the other techniques
 even if only one artificial feature is created.
 In fact, in some cases of countries, the test error of the proposed technique
 is so low that it is almost zero.
 Using more than one feature appears to drastically reduce the error, although
 the reduction appears to be more significant between one and two features
 and less when a third constructed feature is added.
 Also, the Adam method appears to achieve worse results than the PSO and
 the Genetic algorithm methods and this is expected, since this method is
 a local optimization technique, while the PSO and the Genetic algorithms
 are global optimization methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional experiments were performed to evaluate the parameters used in
 the proposed method.
 The figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Average_chromosomes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows the average error of the proposed method with 2 constructed features
 for all experiment countries.
 In these experiments, a varying number of chromosomes was used from 100
 to 1000.
 As expected, the proposed method reduces the average error as the number
 of chromosomes increases.
 This means, however, that the execution time of the method increases as
 well as the memory that will be needed to store the computational structures.
 Therefore, the value of 500 used in the proposed method for the number
 of chromosomes is a good compromise between the speed and efficiency of
 the proposed technique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the number of generations of the genetic algorithm, similar experiment
s were done with this number between 50 and 400.
 The results of these experiments are shown in graph 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Average_generations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Again, increasing the number of generations seems to reduce the error,
 although the reduction is not as drastic as it was with the increase in
 chromosomes.
 Again, the choice of 200 made for the number of generations in the experiments
 appears to be a fair compromise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the total test error for
 the prediction of COVID-19 cases in different countries of the proposed
 method (FC1, FC2, and FC3) with the respective total test error for ADAM,
 MLPPSO, and MLPGEN optimization methods.
 The results obtained through those statistical tests are shown in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 We also compared the average error in predicting deaths per country of
 the proposed method (FC1, FC2, and FC3) with the average error for ADAM,
 MLPPSO, and MLPGEN optimization methods using the Wilcoxon signed-rank
 test.

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, the use of a feature construction technique to predict the
 cases of COVID19 disease and also to predict the mortality due to it was
 presented.
 The prediction was made on widely available data for 10 randomly selected
 countries.
 The proposed method constructs new features from existing ones using Grammatica
l Evolution and evaluates them using a radial basis network (RBF).
 After the evaluation, the best resulting features are used to train an
 artificial neural network.
 The results of the proposed methodology were compared with those of other
 artificial neural network training techniques and in all cases there was
 a dramatic reduction in the network's error for both case number prediction
 and mortality prediction.
 Furthermore, the more artificial features are created, the lower the neural
 network error.
 Future research should include the physical interpretation of the generated
 features in relation to the nature of the problem.
 Also, future improvements to the method may include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Incorporation of more advanced stopping rules for the genetic algorithms
 of the two phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Usage of another machine learning models instead of the RBF network to evaluate
 the constructed features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Usage of parallel techniques to speed up the feature creation process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use of the technique on data that will also contain demographic characteristics
 of each country, in order to establish whether there is a correlation of
 the rate of cases or mortality with any particular characteristic of some
 countries.
