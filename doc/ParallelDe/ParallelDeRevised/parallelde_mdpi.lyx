\begin_layout Abstract
Global optimization is a widely used technique that finds application in
 many sciences such as physics, economics, medicine, etc.
 and with many extensions, as for example, in the area of machine learning.
 However, in many cases, global minimization techniques require high computation
al time and, for this reason, parallel computational approaches should be
 used.
 In this paper, a new parallel global optimization technique based on the
 differential evolutionary method is proposed.
 This new technique uses a series of independent parallel computing units
 that periodically exchange the best solutions they have found.
 Additionally, a new termination rule is proposed here that exploits parallelism
 to accelerate process termination in a timely and valid manner.
 The new method was applied to a number of problems in the established literatur
e and the results were quite promising.

\begin_layout Standard
The current work proposes a parallel implementation of The Differential
 Evolution (DE) method that aims to speed up the optimization process of
 this particular method and also tries to make adequate use of modern computing
 structures of multi-core architectures.
 The method DE initially generates a population of candidate solutions,
 which iteratively evolves through the crossover process in order to discover
 the global minimum of the objective function.
 The method was applied in various research fields such as electromagnetics

 etc.
 The proposed method partitions processing into independent structural units,
 such as threads, and each of them acts independently.
 Furthermore, the new method proposes a way of communication between the
 different building blocks of parallel processing and a process termination
 technique suitably modified for parallel processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the recent bibliography several methods have been proposed that take
 full advantage of parallel processing, such as parallel techniques

 Also, Weber at al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 proposed a parallel DE method for large scale optimization problems using
 new search mechanisms for the individuals of the sub - populations.
 Chen at al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 proposed a parallel DE method for cluster optimization using modified genetic
 operators.
 Moreover, Penas at al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 suggested an enhanced parallel asynchronous DE algorithm for problems in
 computational systems biology.
 Recently, Sui et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 proposed a parallel compact DE method applied to image segmentation.

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed technique is a modified version of the parallel island methodology
 for the different evolutionary techniques 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "de_island1,de_island2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in the proposed technique, the initial population of agents
 (candidate solutions) is divided into a series of independent populations
 and each individual population evolves independently in a parallel computing
 unit, such as a thread.
 Populations periodically exchange information with each other, such as
 the lowest functional value to which they have been driven.
 The proposed technique uses a new differential weight calculation scheme,
 can use a number of different information exchange methods between the
 parallel computing units, and furthermore proposes a new termination method
 of the optimization process that can take advantage of the parallelism
 so that the optimization terminates in time and valid.

, which is a very popular parallel variant for genetic algorithms.
 For example, if there are 10 agents and 2 islands, then agents 1-5 are
 assigned to island 1 and agents 6-10 to island 2.
 On each island, the process of Differential Evolution is carried out independen
tly.
 Of course, there should be some mechanism for communication between the
 islands as well as some appropriate mechanism for terminating the overall
 process.
 The proposed algorithm is presented next.

 The number in the cells denote average function calls for every test function.
 The number in parentheses stands for the fraction of executions where the
 global optimum was successfully found.
 Absence of this number indicates that the global minimum is computed for
 every independent run (100% success).
 At the end of the table, an additional row named AVERAGE has been added
 and shows the total number of function calls for all test functions and
 the average success rate in locating the global minimum.

As can be seen, as the number of computational threads increases, the required
 number of function calls needed to locate the global minimum decreases,
 with no appreciable difference in the overall reliability of the method,
 which remains extremely high (99-100%).
 In addition, to show the dynamics of the proposed methodology, it was also
 used in the training of an artificial neural network

 for learning a common benchmark problem from machine learning, the wine

 The sums of execution times for 30 independent runs are displayed in Figure

 As we can see, as the number of network weights increases from w=5 to w=20,
 the gain from using multiple processing threads increases as the training
 time decreases noticeably.

In addition, to discover whether there is differentiation using the different
 propagation techniques, additional experiments were performed using 10
 processing threads.
 In each processing thread, as before, the population of each island was
 20 agents.
 The results from these experiments are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 From the experimental results, it appears that most of the time there are
 no significant changes in the total number of function calls except in
 the case of

 propagation.
 There is a significant reduction in function calls, but also a drop in
 reliability techniques from 99% to 91%.
 This may be because, due to the exchange of the best prices between all
 the islands, the total population is locked into local minima.

Furthermore, the proposed method was compared against the original Differential
 Evolution method and two variants from the relevant literature are mentioned
 as DERL and DELB
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The results from this comparison are shown in the Table

\end_inset

.
 As is evident, the proposed technique significantly outperforms the other
 modifications of the different evolutionary method.
 This is largely due to the different differential weight calculation technique
 but also to the proposed termination method.
 The used differential weight calculation technique largely succeeds in
 making a better search of the search space, while the new termination method
 terminates the optimization method in time.
 Also, this new termination technique has been modified to perform well
 in parallel computing environments as well.

\begin_layout Standard
A new global optimization technique was presented in this manuscript, which
 can be performed in parallel computing environments.
 This method is based on the well-known differential evolutionary technique
 and partitions the initial population of agents, so as to create independent
 populations that are executed on parallel computing units.
 The parallel units periodically exchange the best values for the objective
 function with each other, and from the experiments carried out it was found
 that the most robust information exchange technique is the so-called "1
 to 1", where a randomly selected subpopulation exchanges information with
 another randomly selected subpopulation.
 Furthermore, a new termination method was proposed here which can take
 full advantage of the parallel computing environment.
 With this termination rule, the decision to terminate the method can be
 efficiently made even by a small portion of the independent computing units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the experimental results, it appears that the proposed technique can
 successfully find the global minimum in a series of problems from the relevant
 literature, and in fact, as the number of parallel processing units increases,
 the required number of function calls decreases.
 Furthermore, after experiments on a difficult problem such as the training
 of artificial neural networks, it was shown that the time required for
 the optimization process decreases dramatically with the increase of threads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, much can still be done to improve the methodology, such as finding
 a better way of communication between parallel processing units or even
 formulating more efficient termination criteria that exploit parallel computing
 environments.
 In addition, the proposed technique could be applied to other global optimizati
on techniques such as genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization.
