\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper, a new sampling technique is proposed that can be used in
 the Multistart global optimization technique as well as techniques based
 on it.
 The new method takes a limited number of samples from the objective function
 and then uses them to train an RBF neural network.
 Subsequently, several samples were taken from the artificial neural network
 this time, and those with the smallest network value in them are used in
 the global optimization method.
 The proposed technique was applied to a wide range of objective functions
 from the relevant literature and the results were extremely promising.

\begin_layout Standard
A novel method to draw samples for global optimization methods is presented
 here.
 The process of locating the global minimum of a continuous and differentiable
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:S\rightarrow R,S\subset R^{n}$
\end_inset

 is described as, determine 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x)\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]

\end_inset

The above problem is commonly used to describe problems in economics

 The global optimization methods have two major categories: deterministic
 and stochastic methods.
  The most common methods of the first category are the so-called Interval
 methods

, where the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is divided iteratively in subregions and some subregions that do not contain
 the global solution are discarded using some pre-defined criteria.
 The majority of the methods belong to the second category where the reader
 can find Controlled Random Search methods

This paper proposes an innovative sampling technique for the Multistart
 stochastic global sampling method.
 The Multistart technique is one of the simplest stochastic global optimization
 techniques and is the basis for many modern global optimization methods.
 In the Multistart method, a series of random samples are taken from the
 objective function and then a local optimization method is started from
 each sample.
 Regarding its simplicity, the method has been used with success in a wide
 area of practical applications, such as the TSP problem

 Usually, in the Multistart method, samples are used from the objective
 function using some distribution such as the uniform distribution.
 In the present work, it is proposed that these samples are obtained from
 a radial basis network

 In practice, the method takes N samples at each iteration and starts a
 local minimization method for each sample, without doing any other checking.
 However, despite its simplicity, it has two key components which, with
 proper adaptation, can make the method extremely efficient.
 The first component is the termination method used and the second is the
 sampling method within the central iteration.
 The local search procedure used here is an adaptation of the BFGS method

 The second point, which this paper focuses on, is the sampling method.
 Usually, sampling is done with random samples from some distribution such
 as the uniform one.
 In this paper, samples will be taken from an approximation of the objective
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$

 constructed using an RBF neural network.
 This approach is discussed in subsection

The used termination rule
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:The-used-termination"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical termination method used is the maximum number of iterations, i.e.
 to terminate the method when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Iter}\ge\mbox{ITER}_{\mbox{MAX}}$
\end_inset

.
 However, this way of termination is not particularly efficient, since for
 small values of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{ITER}_{\mbox{MAX}}$
\end_inset

 number the total minimum may not be found, while for larger values of it
 it may be found at an early stage of the search and then the computer wastes
 time on calls of local search method.
 As an example, consider the Hansen function, defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{5}i\cos\left[(i-1)x_{1}+i\right]\sum_{j=1}^{5}j\cos\left[(j+1)x_{2}+j\right],x\in[-10,10]^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 The global minimum for the function is -176.541793.
 The progress of solving the above function with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{ITER}_{\mbox{MAX}}=100$
\end_inset

 is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hansenPlot"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The global minimum was discovered too early, at the 21th iteration, but
 the algorithm continues until Iter=100, spending 80% of computing time.
 The termination rule used in this work was first proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ga_tsoulos"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: at every iteration 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 the variance of the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x^{*}\right)$
\end_inset

 is calculated.
 This quantity is denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{(n)}$
\end_inset

.
 If the variance falls below a predetermined threshold, then the method
 is terminated.
 This limit is half the value of this variance for the last time a new low
 was found for 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The algorithm terminates when 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v^{(n)}\le\frac{v^{(\mbox{nlast})}}{2}\label{eq:termination_mine}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{nlast}$
\end_inset

 is the last iteration where a new better estimation of the global minimum
 was discovered.
 A graphical representation for the proposed method and the function EXP8
 is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:exp8_plot"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The value 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{(n)}$
\end_inset

 is denoted as VARIANCE in the plot and the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{v^{(\mbox{nlast})}}{2}$
\end_inset

 is denoted as STOPAT.
 The function EXP8 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=-\exp\left(-0.5\sum_{i=1}^{8}x_{i}^{2}\right),\quad-1\le x_{i}\le1
\]

\end_inset

The method now terminates at generation 12.

 networks significantly reduces the required number of function calls needed
 to find the total minimum.
 This reduction is proportional to the objective function and can reach
 up to 60% of the original number of function calls.
 In addition, the usage of the ISAMPLES parameter significantly increases
 the reliability of the new sampling method.
 For example, in the case where N=20 there is an increase in the average
 success rate for finding the total minimum from 90% to approximately 96%.
 However, improving the reliability of the method does not imply an increase
 in the number of function calls.
 For example, for N=20 the calls are in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[75000,90000]$
\end_inset

 without showing any clear increase.
 However, the use of the new sampling technique requires significantly more
 computing time than the uniform distribution because of the need to train
 the RBF networks and also because of the classification that precedes taking
 the final samples.
 This difference is demonstrated in Figure

\end_inset

.
 In this we see the significant difference in running time for the SINU
 problem with a different number of dimensions each time.

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, an innovative sampling technique was proposed for the Multistart
 global optimization method.
 The new technique improves on using a limited number of samples from the
 objective function in order to construct an estimator of the function.
 The estimator in the present work was an RBF neural network.
 After the neural network is trained, a large number of samples are taken
 from the estimator without using the objective function anymore.
 Of these samples, only those with the lowest functional value of the estimator
 are used by the global optimization method.
 From the experiments performed on a wide range of objective functions,
 many of which had a large number of dimensions, it appears that the proposed
 technique significantly outperforms the traditionally used uniform sampling.
 The gain in the number of calls in many cases exceeds 60%.
 Nevertheless, the new technique requires more computational time than the
 uniform distribution, since it is required to train the network as well
 as to classify a series of samples from it.
 However, this increase in time could be significantly reduced with the
 potential use of parallel computing techniques to train neural networks.
 Moreover, in large computational problems, where the cost of evaluating
 the objective function is extremely large, the training time of a neural
 network will be almost negligible.
 Future research may include:
