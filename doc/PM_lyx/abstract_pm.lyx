% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
Parallel optimization is a potent tool for solving optimization problems
 across various domains.
 By harnessing multiple computational resources simultaneously, optimization
 methods can achieve faster convergence and improved performance.
 Parallel implementation involves executing multiple different methods concurren
tly, such as evolutionary algorithms, swarm-based optimization, or multiple
 restarts.
 The objective is the effective exploration of the search space and the
 attainment of optimal solutions in less time.
 However, defined termination criteria are crucial to prevent uncontrolled
 execution of the algorithm, thereby conserving computational resources
 and time.
 Within the scope of this study, a pioneering combination of termination
 rules and a mechanism for transferring the optimal solution among computational
 units is proposed.
 The proposed additions have been tested on a series of well-known optimization
 problems from relevant literature, and the results are reported.
