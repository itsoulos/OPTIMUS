\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial Neural Networks are machine learning models widely used in many
 sciences as well as in practical applications.
 The basic element of these models is a vector of parameters, the values
 of which should be estimated using some computational method, and this
 process is called training.
 For effective training of the network, computational methods from the field
 of global minimization are often used.
 However, for global minimization techniques to be effective, the bounds
 of the objective function should also be clearly defined.
 In this paper, a two-stage global optimization technique is presented for
 efficient training of artificial neural networks.
 In the first stage, the bounds for the neural network parameters are estimated
 using Particle Swarm Optimization and, in the following phase, the parameters
 of the network are optimized within the bounds of the first phase using
 global optimization techniques.
 The suggested method was used on a series of well-known problems in the
 literature and the experimental results were more than encouraging.

 Usually, neural networks are defined as a function 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w})$
\end_inset

, provided that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 is the input pattern to the network and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 stands for the weight vector.
 To estimate the weight vector, the so-called training error is minimized,
 which is defined as the sum:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E(\overrightarrow{w})=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In equation

\end_inset

 the values t 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 defined the training set for the neural network.
 The values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 denote the expected output for the pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$

However, in many cases, the training methods of artificial neural networks
 suffer from the problem of overfitting, i.e.
 although they succeed in significantly reducing the training error of equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

, they do not perform similarly on unknown data that was not present during
 training.
 These unknown data sets are commonly called test sets.
 The overfitting problem is usually handle using a a variety of methods,
 such as weight sharing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key reason why the problem of overtraining in artificial neural networks
 is present, is that there is no well-defined interval of values in which
 the network parameters are initialized and trained by the optimization
 methods.
 This, in practice, means that the values of the parameters are changed
 indiscriminately in order to reduce the value of the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eq1"

.
 In this work it is proposed to use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
 technique 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "psoTutorial"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for the reliable calculation of the value interval of the parameters of
 an artificial neural network.
 The PSO method was chosen since it is a fairly fast global optimization
 method, easily adaptable to any optimization problem, and does not require
 many execution parameters to be defined by the user.
 The PSO method was applied with success to many difficult problems, such
 as problems that arise in physics

 In the proposed method, the PSO technique is used to minimize the equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:eq1"

\end_inset

 to which a penalty factor has been added, so as not to allow the parameters
 of artificial neural networks to vary uncontrollably.
 After the minimization of the modified function is done, the parameters
 of the neural network are initialized in an interval of values around the
 optimal value located by the PSO method, and then the original form of
 equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eq1"

 is minimized without a penalty factor this time.

Preliminaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose a neural network with a hidden processing layer is available that
 uses the so - called sigmoid function as activation function.
 The sigmoid function is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The equation for every hidden node of the neural network has as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
o_{i}(x)=\sigma\left(p_{i}^{T}x+\theta_{i}\right),\label{eq:eq1-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the weight vector and the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 denotes the bias the node 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the total equation for a neural network with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 hidden has as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}v_{i}o_{i}(x),\label{eq:eq1-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The value 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 denotes the output weight for node

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The value 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 stands for the dimension of the input vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Observing the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 it is obvious that in many cases, the sigmoid function is driven to 1 or
 0 and as a consequence the training error of the neural network can get
 trapped in local minima and finally, the neural network it will lose its
 generalization abilities.
 Therefore, a technique should be devised by which the values of the sigmoid
 will be restricted to some interval of values.
 In the present work, the limitation of the neural network parameters to
 a range of values is carried out using the Particle Swarm Optimization
 method.

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the sigmoid function of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sig"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 , if the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is large, then the function will very quickly tend to 1 and if it is very
 small, it will very quickly tend to 0.
 This means that the function will very quickly lose any generalizing abilities
 it has.
 Therefore, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 should somehow be in some interval of values, so that there are no generalizati
on problems.
 For this reason, the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $B(L)$
\end_inset

 is estimated, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is a limit for the absolute value of the parameter x of the sigmoid function.
 The steps for this calculation are shown in Algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This function will eventually return the average of the overruns made for
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 parameter of the sigmoid function.
 The higher this average is, the more likely it is that the artificial neural
 network will not be able to generalize satisfactorily.

The PSO algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Particle Swarm Optimization method is based on a swarm of vectors that
 commonly called particles.
 These particles can also be considered potential values of the total minimum
 of the objective function.
 Each particle is associated with two vectors: the current position denoted
 as
\series bold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{p}$
\end_inset


\series default
 and the corresponding speed 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{u}$
\end_inset


\series default
 at which they are moving towards the global minimum.
 In addition, each particle maintains in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i,b}$
\end_inset

 the best position in which it has been so far and the total population,
 maintains in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\mbox{best}}$
\end_inset

 the best position that any of the particles have found in the past.
 The purpose of the method is to move the total population toward the global
 minimum through a series of iterations.
 In each iteration, the velocity of each particle is calculated based on
 its current position, its best position in the past and the best located
 position of the population.

In this work, the PSO technique is used to train artificial neural networks
 by minimizing the error function as defined in the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eq1-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 along with a penalty factor depending on the function 
\begin_inset Formula $B(L)$
\end_inset

 defined in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-bounding-algorithm"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hence, the PSO technique will minimize the equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{T}\left(N\left(x,w\right),L\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\times\left(1+\alpha B(L)\right)\label{eq:etotal}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 is a penalty factor with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1$

Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make a reliable estimate of the efficiency of the method, the ten - fold
 validation method was used and and 30 experiments were conducted.
 In every experiment different random values were used.
 The neural network used in the experiments has one hidden layers with 10
 neurons.
 The selected activation function is the sigmoid function.
 The average classification or regression error on the test set is reported
 in the experimental tables.
 The parameters used in the experiments are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The proposed method is compared against some other methods from the relevant
 literature:

 Also, in order to achieve a better solution, the local optimization method
 BFGS is applied to the best chromosome of the population when the genetic
 algorithm terminates.

The proposed two-phase technique is shown to outperform the others in both
 classification and regression problems in terms of accuracy on the test
 set.
 In many data sets the difference in accuracy provided by the proposed technique
 can reach or even exceed 70% and this is more evident in regresion dataset,
 where the average gain from the next best is 54%.
 In the case of the classification data, the most effective method before
 the proposed one appears to be the genetic algorithm and the difference
 in accuracy between them is of the order of 23%.
 On the other hand, for the regression datasets, the radial basis network
 is the next most effective after the proposed technique and the average
 difference in accuracy between them is of the order of 47%.Also, a comparison
 in terms of precision and recall between the proposed method and the genetic
 algorithm is shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:precision"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for a series of select classification datasets.
 And in this table, the proposed technique shows higher accuracy than the
 genetic algorithm method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, the effectiveness of the usage of the BFGS local search method is
 measure on an additional experiment, where the local search method for
 the proposed technique is replace by the ADAM optimizer.
 The results for the classification datasets are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:exp1Adam"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the corresponding results for the regression datasets in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:exp2Adam"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In both tables, the column PROPOSED_BFGS denotes the application of the
 proposed method using the BFGS local search as the procedure of the second
 phase and the column PROPOSED_ADAM denotes the incorporation of the ADAM
 optimizer during the second phase instead of the BFGS.

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can give
 excellent results in learning categories or in learning functions even
 if the Adam method is used as a local minimization method.
 However, the Adam method requires a much longer execution time than the
 Bfgs method and this is shown graphically in Figure

This graph shows the running time for the Abalone dataset, which is a time-consu
ming problem.
 The first column shows the execution time for the simple genetic algorithm,
 in the second column is the execution time for the proposed method using
 the Bfgs local optimization method in the second phase and in the third
 column is the execution time for the proposed method using the Adam method
 in the second stage.
 Although, as shown in the previous tables, the Adam method can have similar
 levels of success as the Bfgs method, it nevertheless requires significant
 computing time for its completion.

Also, the average regression error for the proposed method when then number
 of particles increases from 50 to 400 is graphically outlined in Figure

 The proposed technique achieves the best results when the number of particles
 in the particle swarm optimization exceeds 100.
 However, the average error is about the same for 200 and 400 particles,
 and therefore choosing 200 particles to run experiments appears to be more
 effective, since it will require less computing time.

In addition, in order to see if there is a dependence of the results on
 the critical parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 of the proposed method, a series of additional experiments were carried
 out in which these parameters were varied.
 In the first phase, the proposed technique was applied to the regression
 datasets for different values of the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 varying from 2.5 to 20.0 and the average regression error is graphically
 shown in Figure

If one judges from the experimental results, it is clear that the increase
 in the value of the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 positively affects the performance of the method, but after the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=10$
\end_inset

 this effect decreases drastically.
 For low values of this coefficient, there is a limitation of the parameters
 of the artificial neural network to low values and therefore a lag in the
 accuracy of the neural network is expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, corresponding experiments were performed with the value of
 the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 increasing from 2 to 15 and these are graphically illustrated in figure

For the experiments with the coefficient φ one can see that the gain from
 any variation of this coefficient is limited, although the lowest values
 of the average error are achieved when the coefficient has a value close

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, a two-stage technique for efficient training of artificial
 neural networks problems found in many scientific fields was presented.
 During the first phase, a widely used global optimization technique such
 as the Particle Swarm Optimization was used to minimize the training error
 of the artificial neural network to which a penalty factor had been added.
 This penalty factor is incorporated to maintain the effectiveness of the
 artificial neural network to generalize to unknown data as well.
 The calculation of the penalty factor is based on the observation that
 the artificial neural network can lose its generalization abilities when
 the input values in the sigmoid activation function exceed some predetermined
 threshold.
 After the particle optimization technique is performed in the second phase,
 the best particle is used both as an initializer of a local optimization
 method and as a basis for calculating bounds on the parameters of the artificia
l neural network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suggested method was applied to a wide range of classification and regressio
n problems found in the recentt literature and the experimental results
 were more than encouraging.
 In addition, when comparing the proposed technique with other widely used
 methods from the relevant literature, it seems that the proposed technique
 significantly outperforms them, especially in the case of regression problems.
 In relevant experiments carried out regarding the sensitivity of the proposed
 technique on its critical parameters, it was found to be quite robust without
 large error fluctuations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future extensions of the technique may include its application to other
 network cases such as Radial Basis Function artificial neural networks
 (RBFs), as well as the use of global optimization methods in the second
 stage of the proposed technique or even the creation of appropriate termination
 techniques.
