% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial Neural Networks are machine learning models widely used in many
 sciences as well as in practical applications.
 The basic element of these models is a vector of parameters, the values
 of which should be estimated using some computational method, and this
 process is called training.
 For effective training of the network, computational methods from the field
 of global minimization are often used.
 However, for global minimization techniques to be effective, the bounds
 of the objective function should also be clearly defined.
 In this paper, a two-stage global optimization technique is presented for
 efficient training of artificial neural networks.
 In the first stage, the bounds for the neural network parameters are estimated
 using Particle Swarm Optimization and in the second phase the network parameter
s are trained within the bounds of the first phase using global optimization
 techniques.
 The proposed technique was applied to a number of well-known problems in
 the literature and the experimental results were more than encouraging.
