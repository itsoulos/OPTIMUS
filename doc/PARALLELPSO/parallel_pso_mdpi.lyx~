\begin_layout Abstract
In the area of global optimization, a variety of techniques have been developed
 to find the global minimum.
 These techniques, in most cases, require a significant amount of computational
 resources and time to complete and therefore there is a need to develop
 parallel techniques.
 In addition, the wide spread of parallel architectures in recent years
 greatly facilitates the implementation of such techniques.
 Among the most widely used global optimization techniques is the Particle
 Swarm Optimization technique.
 In this work, a series of modifications are proposed in the direction of
 efficient parallelization for Particle Swarm Optimization.
 These modifications include an innovative velocity calculation mechanism
 that has also been successfully used in the serial version of the method,
 mechanisms for propagating the best particles between parallel computing
 units, but also a process termination mechanism, which has been properly
 configured for efficient execution in parallel computing environments.
 The proposed technique was applied to a multitude of computational problems
 from the relevant literature and the results were more than promising,
 since it was found that increasing the computational threads can significantly
 reduce the required number of function calls to find the global minimum.
 The proposed technique is at rate of 50-70% of the required number of function
 calls compared to other optimization techniques.
 This reduction is visible even if 1-2 parallel processing units are used.
 In addition, with the increase in parallel processing units, a drastic
 reduction in the number of calls is observed and therefore a reduction
 in the required computing time, which can reach up to 70%.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The global optimization problem is usually defined as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x)\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where the function f is assumed to be continuous and differentiable.
 There is a wide range of problems in the relevant literature that can be
 treated as global optimization problems.
 In the physical, for example, Yang et al proposed a multiobjective genetic
 algorithm on an accelerator lattice

, Iuliano proposed global optimization techniques for benchmark aerodynamic
 cases and Duan et al used global optimization techniques for Conceptual

 In the area of chemistry, Heils and Johnston provided a review on the usage
 of global optimization techniques on clusters
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, Shin et al proposed a software that utilizes global optimization methods

 and Liwo et al proposed a global optimization algorithm for protein structure
 prediction by minimizing the potential energy function

 In addition, in the area of economic sciences, Gaing proposed a Particle
 Swarm Optimization method to solve the economic dispatch

 and Maranas et al proposed global optimization methods for tackling long

 Furthermore, in medicine, Lee proposed large - scale optimization - based
 classification models applied in medical problems

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways to categorize global optimization techniques, but
 most researchers suggest dividing them into two broad categories: deterministic
 and stochastic techniques.
 In the area of deterministic techniques, the one with the greatest spread
 among researchers is the Interval method
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "interval1,interval2"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, where the initial interval of values 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of the objective function is continuously divided into smaller parts.
 The segments that may not contain the total minimum are discarded and eventuall
y a very narrow interval of values should be left which will contain the
 total minimum of the objective function.
 Also, in the area of deterministic methods, many related works with various
 applications, such as the work of Maranas and Floudas that proposed a determini
stic method for molecular structure determination 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "determ1"

\end_inset

, the TRUST method for global optimization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "determ2"

\end_inset

, the method of Evtushenko and Posypkin for global box - constrained optimizatio
n 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, a method that uses smooth diagonal auxiliary functions to approximate
 the global minimum 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "determ4"

\end_inset

 etc.
 Also, Kunde et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "determ5"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggested the usage of deterministic global optimization methods for chemical
 problems.
 Furthermore, recently, Sergeyev et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Sergeyev"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 proposed a systematic comparison between deterministic and stochastic methods
 used to handle the global optimization problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, in the category of stochastic techniques, where the greatest
 research effort is made, techniques are presented that look for the total
 minimum using stochastic methods, which, of course, does not guarantee
 finding the total minimum.
 In this vast area of research endeavors one encounters methods such as
 controlled random search methods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "crs1,crs2,crs3"

 which can be considered as a direct search method, simulated annealing

 In addition, since in recent years there has been an extremely wide spread
 of parallel computing units, many studies have appeared that utilize the
 modern parallel processing units 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gpu1,gpu2,gpu3"

\end_inset

 to tackle the global optimization problem.
 Some research that one can study regarding metaheuristic algorithms is
 presented in some recent papers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "meta1,meta2,meta3"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This paper suggests a number of directions for efficient parallelization
 of particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PSO method is inspired by the observations of Eberhart and Kennedy in
 the 1990s.
 The two observed in detail the behavior of birds as they move through space
 looking for food and then formulated a technique that falls under the domain
 of global optimization, using the experience they gained from their observation
s.
 In the new technique they formulated, the atoms or particles move in the
 research space of the problem in search of the minimum of the objective
 function.
 These particles are directly related to two basic characteristics: the
 current position of each particle and the velocity at which it moves in
 search of the global minimum.
 The current position is denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 and the velocity is referred to as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{u}$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, for each particle, the best position in which it has been
 found in the past (the one with the smallest value for the objective function)
 is kept in memory, but also, for the total population, its best position
 is kept.
 The method moves the particles to search for the global minimum through
 an iterative process, in which the positions of the particles at each iteration
 are derived from each particle's current position, the best position it
 has found in previous iterations, and the overall best position of the
 population.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the simplicity of the method and the small number of parameters that
 should be set, this method has been applied to many difficult problems
 from all areas of the sciences, such as problems that arise in physics

 Since the technique has gained a lot of popularity in recent years, many
 works have been developed based on it, such as combination with the mutation

key "pso_parallel1,pso_parallel2,pso_parallel3"

 Also, since the calculation of the velocity of the particles is a determining
 factor for the effectiveness of the method, several techniques were formulated
 for the calculation of the velocity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pso_velocity1,pso_velocity2,pso_velocity3"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 The method of particle swarm optimization has been successfully combined
 with other global optimization techniques, such as the work of Bogdanova
 et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ge_pso1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who suggested a combination of Grammatical Evolution with PSO 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ge_mainpaper"

\end_inset

.
 Also Pan et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "siman_pso"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggested a method that combines the PSO method with a variation of the
 simulated annealing.
 Likewise, Mughal et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "simman_pso_energy"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, proposed a hybrid technique that effectively combines PSO and simulated
 annealing for solar energy problems.
 In the same way, Lin et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pso_de"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggested a hybrid method of PSO and differential evolution for some optimizati
on problems.
 Additionally, a number of techniques have been presented in which local
 minimization methods are applied to some iterations of Particle Swarm Optimizat
ion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pso_local1,pso_local2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Of course, these techniques significantly increase the computational time
 required by the method, but also significantly improve the performance
 of the method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the topic of global optimization is very widely applied in many fields
 but also due to the fact that it requires significant computing resources,
 techniques that take advantage of parallel architectures have to be developed
 to reduce the required computing time.
 For example, Olenšek et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "parallel_go1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 proposed an asynchronous parallel global optimization method based on simulated
 annealing and differential evolution applied on a series of benchmark global
 optimization problems.
 Also, Regis and Shoemaker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "paralleGo2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 employed Radial Basis Functions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "rbf1"

\end_inset

 for parallel global optimization.
 A systematic review of parallel metaheuristics can be found in the work
 of Alba et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "parallelReview1"

\end_inset

.
 Also, a review of metaheuristics that are implemented on modern GPU architectur
es can be found in the work of Essaid et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "parallelReview2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The Particle Swarm Optimization method is an excellent candidate method
 for parallelization, since it is based on a series of computational solutions
 that partially act independently of each other.
 For example, Koh et al proposed a parallel asynchronous implementation
 of the PSO algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, Tewolde et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 proposed a Multi - swarm PSO algorithm where the swarm is divided into
 a set of subswarms that are executed in parallel.

In the present work, the initial population of Particle Swarm Optimization
 is divided into independent populations running on different parallel computing
 units, which will also be called islands.
 In addition, a number of techniques are proposed, which aim at efficient
 communication between the independent islands on the one hand, and at the
 early termination of the overall method on the other.
 These techniques include a new method of calculating particle velocity,
 a new termination rule specifically modified for parallel techniques, and
 a new way of propagating the best particles among the parallel computing
 units involved in the overall method.
 The proposed velocity calculation is proposed by Eberhart and Shi

 and it is based on random values.
 Also, the proposed stopping rule is based on the work of Charilogis and
 Tsoulos

 The two main components of the proposed parallel implementation are the
 particle propagation mechanism between the parallel computing units and
 the proposed termination rule.
 In the first case, it must be decided which units will send the best particles
 to other parallel units.
 Units receiving particles replace their worst members with the ones they
 receive.
 In the second case, a termination rule based on asymptotic observations
 is proposed for early termination of the parallel technique.
 In the proposed termination technique, the overall algorithm is terminated
 if it holds with some certainty if some asymptotic termination criterion
 holds for at least one parallel computing unit.
 These components will be discussed in the following subsections.

Propagation mechanism

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the execution of the parallel algorithm and periodically, the processing
 units propagate their best particles (those with the lowest function value)
 to the remaining processing units.
 This propagation can be achieved in the following possible ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
1 to 1
\series default
.
 In this propagation scheme, a randomly selected processing unit will send
 to some other randomly selected unit its 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{P}$
\end_inset

 best particles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold

 During this scheme, a randomly selected unit will send its best

 particles to the remaining units.

 In this scheme, all processing units will send the corresponding

 best particles of each unit to a randomly selected unit.

Stopping rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the proposed technique, a distinct termination rule is checked on each
 parallel processing unit.
 This rule is formulated as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta_{i}^{(k)}=\left|f_{i,\mbox{min}}^{(k)}-f_{i,\mbox{min}}^{(k-1)}\right|\label{eq:term}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This quantity is calculated on every iteration 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 The value 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i,\mbox{min}}^{(k)}$
\end_inset

 is the best function value for unit 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at iteration 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 If the above quantity is less than a predetermined limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{M}$
\end_inset

 continuous repetitions, then the algorithm executed on this unit is terminated.
 In present work, if a parallel processing unit is terminated, then the
 overall process is also terminated.

In order to be able to establish the efficiency of the method in finding
 the total minimum of continuous functions, a series of experiments were
 performed in which objective functions from the relevant literature were
 used
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 These objective functions have been extensively studied by many researchers
 in many publications

\end_inset

.
 In this series of experiments, beyond the ability of the method to find
 the global minimum, the effect of changes in a number of critical parameters,
 such as propagation techniques, on the behavior of the proposed method
 was also evaluated.
 In addition, experiments were conducted in which the actual execution time
 was measured for various objective functions.
 In these experiments, the actual reduction in execution time was also recorded
 as the number of parallel processing units increased.

In the first set of experiments, the serial version of the proposed technique,
 i.e.
 running on a single processor, was compared with two widely used global
 optimization techniques: a genetic algorithm and a simple version of Particle
 Swarm Optimization.
 In all cases the same number of particles or chromosomes and the same maximum
 number of generations were used.
 In addition, after each method was executed, the local optimization method
 BFGS was used to improve the global minimum found.
 The results for this experiment are reported in Table

In the table, each number in each cell represents the average of the function
 calls for 30 runs.
 Also, the numbers in parentheses stand for the percentage of runs in which
 the global minimum was successfully found.
 If this percentage is not present, it implies 100% success.
 In addition, a line has been added at the end of the table showing the
 total number of function calls for each method.
 The experimental results demonstrate that even running the proposed technique
 on a single computing unit can result to better results than the other
 techniques in terms of the required number of function calls and, by extension,
 the required time required to find the global minimum.

In order to evaluate the effect of executing the method on parallel processing
 units, another experiment was done in which the number of parallel processing
 units was increased from 1 to 10 and the results are presented in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:t1results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Also, a box plot for this experiment is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:boxplot1to1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, a Friedman test was conducted to determine whether there
 were significant differences in the scores of function calls on five (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{I}$
\end_inset

 =1, 2, 4, 5, and 10) repeated number of units and the results are shown
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nonPar"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, in order to give greater reliability to the experimental results,
 the total number of particles was in all runs constant and equal to 200,
 as defined in the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:values"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This means, for example, that when the computing units are 4 each unit
 will run a serial version of PSO with 50 particles and when the computing
 units become 5 the number of particles in each unit will be reduced to
 40.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We conducted a Friedman test to determine whether there were significant
 differences in the scores of function calls on five (N i =1, 2, 4, 5, and
 10) repeated number of units.
 The Friedman chi- square was 94.38 with 4 degrees of freedom, indicating
 a significant difference between the groups (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

).

From the experimental results it is clear that increasing the number of
 parallel processing nodes further reduces the total number of function
 calls, since more units are used in the attempt to find the global minimum.
 In addition, a slight increase in the reliability of the method in finding
 the total minimum is also observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, to determine the effect of the propagation mechanism on the
 reliability and speed of the method, another comparative experiment was
 performed, in which the number of parallel processing units was set to
 5 (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{I}$
\end_inset

 = 5) and all propagation mechanisms were used.
 The results for this experiment are presented in Table

This time, the experimental results did not show any clear superiority of
 one of the propagation methods.
 However, it appears that the 1-to-N propagation method has slightly better
 performances than the rest of the best particle propagation techniques
 among the sub-populations.

 parameter on the speed of the method.
 In it, 5 parallel computing units were used and the propagation method
 was set to

As is evident, increasing the value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{P}$
\end_inset

 parameter significantly reduces the required number of function calls up
 to a value of 5.
 From then on, the total number of calls appears to be constant.
 Practically, this means that sending not only the best particle but also
 those with the immediately lower value further reduces the required number
 of function calls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiments for the execution time 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand the efficiency of the method with respect to execution time,
 three additional series of experiments were performed.
 In all experiments, the total number of particles in the particle swarm
 optimization was fixed at 500 and from 1 to 20 parallel processing units
 were used and the total execution time was measured for 30 different independen
t runs.
 The experiments were conducted on AMD Epyc 7552 equipped with 32GB of RAM.
 The operating system was the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the first series of the additional experiments, the High Conditioned
 Elliptic function, defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(10^{6}\right)^{\frac{i-1}{n-1}}x_{i}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

was used as a test case.
 In the experiments, the values n=10,20,30,40,50 were used and the experimental
 results are displayed graphically in the figure

From the experimental results, it follows that doubling the parallel processing
 units almost halves the required execution time in most cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the second series of experiments, different versions of the GKLS
 function were used for dimensions from 2 to 5.
 This function was thoroughly tested also in the work of Sergeyev et al
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In each dimension, 10 different instances of the function were used to
 have a safe estimate of both the performance of the method and the possible
 decrease in execution time as the parallel processing units.

The average execution time for different dimensions of the GKLS function
 and for different numbers of processing units is graphically shown in Figure

As is shown, the execution time decreases rapidly with increasing parallel
 processing units in all instances of the function.
 Furthermore, the average number of function calls for every case is also
 measured and the results are plotted in Figure

Increasing the number of parallel processing units also reduces the number
 of required function calls, especially for the low-dimensional cases (Gkls2
 and Gkls3).
 However, the most interesting point of this series of experiments is the
 ability of the proposed technique to locate the global minimum as the number
 of parallel computing units increases.
 This capability is graphically represented in Figure

 From this graph it can be concluded that the increase of parallel processing
 units significantly improves the efficiency of the technique in finding
 the global minimum.

In the third series of additional experiments, a more difficult experiment
 was used, but one that has multiple applications.
 The proposed method was used to train an artificial neural network

In the present work a number of ideas were presented that can lead to an
 efficient parallel implementation of the PSO technique.
 The need for parallelization of the method is great, as it is an iterative
 process involving repeated operations on vectors and these operations for
 large problems may require significantly large computational time.
 In the current work, a technique of propagating the best particles between
 computing units as well as a termination rule of the overall process were
 introduced.
 In the case of the propagation of the best particles from the experiments
 carried out, it appears that it is more efficient to send between the computing
 units more than the best particle.
 Furthermore, the propagation method between parallel computing units did
 not have a drastic effect on the efficiency and speed of the method, although
 the 1-to-N propagation method appeared to have slightly better results.
 Furthermore, the increase of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{P}$
\end_inset

 from 1 to 5 decreased the required number of function calls.
 However, the biggest gain from using the method lies in the increase in
 parallel processing units.
 From the experiments performed, it is evident that as parallel processing
 units increase, the total function calls required to find the global minimum
 decreases almost for every objective function.
 In addition, the increase in parallel processing units improved to some
 extent the efficiency of the method in finding the global minimum.
 The effectiveness of the proposed method was also shown in the comparison
 between its serial version and two other widely available techniques in
 the relevant literature.
 In this comparison the serial version of the method required significantly
 fewer function calls to find each global minimum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a percentage basis, the proposed technique significantly outperforms
 the other two compared global optimization techniques.
 The serial version of the proposed technique reduces the required number
 of function calls by 22%-28% compared to the genetic algorithm and the
 particle swarm optimization techniques respectively.
 However, with the use of more processing units, the reduction in the number
 of function calls reaches approximately 70%.
 Furthermore, from the relevant experiments done on the actual execution
 time, it appears that any doubling of parallel processing threads halves
 the required execution time required to find the global minimum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, the important work done in the parallelization of the PSO
 technique can be continued with the use of new termination rules that will
 be suitable for execution in parallel computing environments but also a
 possible extension of the best particle propagation techniques between
 parallel computing units.
