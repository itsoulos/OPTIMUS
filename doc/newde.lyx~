\begin_layout Abstract
The Differential Evolution (DE) method is a stochastic method of global
 optimization that has been widely used in continuous optimization problems
 from various areas and can be applied to problems that even contain noise.
 The present work proposes two variations for this method.
 The first significantly improves the termination of the method by proposing
 an asymptotic termination rule, which is based on the differentiation of
 the average of the function values in the population of DE.
 The second modification proposes a new scheme for a critical parameter
 of the method, which scheme improves the method's ability to better explore
 the search space of the objective function.
 The proposed variations have been tested on a number of problems from the
 current literature and from the experimental results it appears that the
 proposed modifications render the method quite robust and faster even in
 large-scale problems.

.
 This work introduces two major modifications for the Differential Evolution
 (DE) method, that aim to speed up the algorithm and to reduce the total
 number of function evaluations required by the method.
 The DE method initially creates a population of candidate solutions and
 through a series of iterations creates new solutions by combining the previous
 ones.
 The method does not require any prior knowledge of the derivative and is
 therefore quite fast and has low memory requirements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a literature review it was found that differential evolution is used
 in several areas and many modifications of the original algorithm have
 been introduced in the recent literature.
 More specifically, in the research of Zongjun et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "de_review1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, genetic and differential calculus algorithms were used to optimize the
 parameters of two models aimed at estimating evapotranspiration in three
 regions and it was found that the performance of evolution algorithms was
 better than the genetic algorithm.
 Another research focuses on a case study of a cellular neural network aimed
 at generating fractional classes of neurons.
 The best solutions provided by differential calculus and the use of accelerated
 particle swarm optimization (APSO) are presented concretely in the work
 of Tlelo-Cuautle et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Another article 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "de_review3"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 proposes a regeneration framework based on space search adaptation (ARSA),
 which can be integrated into different variants of different evolution
 to address the problems of early convergence and population stability faced
 by different calculus.
 Also another interesting variation of the method is the Bernstain Search
 Differential Evolution Algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for optimizing numerical functions.
 Another interesting algorithm is a new design of differential evolution
 to solve the travel salesman problem

The differential evolution method was applied also to energy science.
 Specifically, the article of Liang et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 evaluates the parameters of solar photovoltaic models through a self-adjusting
 differential evolution.
 Similarly, in the study of Peng et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, differential evolution is used for the prediction of electricity prices.
 Also, differential evolution was also incorporated in neural architecture

\begin_layout Subsection
The new termination rule 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically the DE method is terminated when a predefined number of iterations
 is reached.
 This can be extremely inefficient in some problems and in others it can
 lead to premature termination, ie termination before the total minimum
 is found.
 In the work of Ali et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ali_de"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 a different termination rule is proposed ie.
 terminate when 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f_{\mbox{max}}-f_{\mbox{min}}\le\epsilon\label{eq:termination_ali}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\mbox{max}}$
\end_inset

 is the function value of the worst agent in the population, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\mbox{min}}$
\end_inset

 is the function value of the best agent and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

is a small positive number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the proposed termination rule, the average function value of the population
 is calculated in each iteration.
 If this value does not change significantly for a repetitive number of
 iterations, then it is very likely that the method may not discover a new
 global minimum and should therefore be terminated.
 Hence in every generation 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 we measure the quantity: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{\ensuremath{\delta^{(t)}=}}\left|\sum_{i=1}^{\mbox{NP}}\left|f_{i}^{(t)}\right|-\sum_{i=1}^{\mbox{NP}}\left|f_{i}^{(t-1)}\right|\right|
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the termination rule is defined as: 
\series bold
terminate
\series default
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{(t)}\le\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for a predefined number of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 generations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The new differential weight
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differential weight initially proposed in the DE algorithm was a static
 value, which means that some tuning is required in order to discover the
 global minimum in every optimization function.
 Ali et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ali_de"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 proposed an adaptation mechanism for this parameter in order that the algorithm
 should search in larger spaces at the the first generations and to become
 more focused at latter generations.
 The mechanism proposed is expressed as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccccc}
\max\left(l_{\mbox{min}},1-\left|\frac{f_{\mbox{max}}}{f_{\mbox{min}}}\right|\right) & , & \mbox{if} & \left|\frac{f_{\mbox{max}}}{f_{\mbox{min}}}\right|\le1\\
\max\left(l_{\mbox{min}},1-\left|\frac{f_{\mbox{min}}}{f_{\mbox{max}}}\right|\right) & , & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.\label{eq:ali_weight}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The current work proposes a stochastic mechanism similar to the crossover
 operation of the Genetic algorithms.
 The proposed scheme is expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F=-\frac{1}{2}+2\times R\label{eq:proposedF}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 is a random number.
 The proposed scheme, as with the randomness introduced by the method DE
 will be able to better explore the search space of the objective function
 and find with greater accuracy and speed the global minimum.
 In addition, this scheme has been used successfully in Genetic Algorithms.

Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the experiments were conducted using different seed for the random generator
 each time and averages were taken.
 The code has been implemented in ANSI C++ and the random generator used
 was the function drand48() of the C programming languages.
 The execution environment was an Intel Xeon E5-2630 multi core machine.
 The parameters used in the experiments are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Experimental-parameters."
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The experiments where the stopping rule of Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:termination_ali"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 was used are outlined in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ExperimentsAli"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the experiments with the proposed stopping rule are listed in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:ExperimentsAli-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The numbers in cells represent average function calls.
 The fraction in parentheses stands for the fraction of runs where the global
 optimum was found.
 If this number is missing then the global minimum was discovered in every
 independent run (100% success).
 The column STATIC represents the static value for the differential weight
 
\begin_inset Formula $(F=0.8)$
\end_inset

, the column ALI stands for the mechanism given in the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ali_weight"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and lastly the column PROPOSED stands for the proposed scheme given in
 the Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:proposedF"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the experiments performed we observe that the two proposed variations
 drastically reduce the required number of function calls.
 Also, the proposed changes do not seem to affect the average performance
 of the method, as it remains high in all cases.
 The effect of the proposed scheme for the differential weight is presented
 graphically in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-effect-of"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, where we plot the average function calls for the functions ROSENBROCK4,
 ROSENBROCK8 and ROSENBROCK16 using the three schemes of the differential
 weight.
 Also, in the plot of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Plot2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the average calls for the same functions are plotted using both the proposed
 scheme for the differential weight and the proposed termination rule.
 It is evident the the combination of both modifications reduced even more
 the average number of function calls required to locate the global minimum
 of the test functions.

\begin_layout Standard
In this text, two main additions to the DE method are presented.
 In the first an asymptotic termination rule was introduced and used successfull
y even in multidimensional problems.
 This rule is based on the observation that from one point onwards the average
 of the functional values of the agents does not change.
 This means that either the algorithm has already found the global minimum
 or its further continuation will have no meaning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second case, a stochastic scheme was used to produce the differential
 weight.
 This scheme helped the algorithm to better explore the search space of
 the objective function without the need for more calls to the objective
 function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed modifications significantly speed up the original method in
 terms of function calls in most cases.
 Each of the proposed modifications can be used separately or together in
 the DE method.
 If used together there is a large reduction in the number of required function
 calls that reaches up to 80% without problems in the reliability of the
 method and its ability to successfully find the total minimum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DE method can also be used in cases of optimization problems with constraint
s as long as there is a change in the original problem so that the constraints
 are included in the function with the usage for example Langrage multipliers.
